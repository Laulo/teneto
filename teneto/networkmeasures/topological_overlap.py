def topological_overlap(tnet, calc='time'): 
    """
    Topological overlap quantifies the persistency of edges through time. If two consequtive time-points have similar edges, this becomes high (max 1). If there is high change, this becomes 0.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tnet : array, dict
        graphlet or contact sequence input. Nettype: 'bu'.
    calc: str 
        which version of topological overlap to calculate
        'node' - calculates for each node, averaging over time. 
        'time' - (default) calculates for each node per time points.
        'global' - (default) calculates for each node per time points.


    Returns
    -------
    topo_overlap : array 
        if calc = 'time', array is (node,time) in size.
        if calc = 'node', array is (node) in size. 
        if calc = 'global', array is (1) in size.
